#Loading filtered data files

## Data Cleaning
### Trips tibble cleaning

```{r}
#Limiting passanger count to between 1 and 6
trips <- filter(trips, between(trips$passenger_count,1,6))
#Removing 0 value distances
trips <- filter(trips, trips$trip_distance>0)
#filtering trip time in secs between 60 seconds to 7200 seconds (2 hours)
trips <- filter(trips, between(trips$trip_time_in_secs,60,7200))
#checking trip time in seconds using the pickup and dropoff datetimes 
#removing all observations in which there is a difference of over 10 seconds
trips<- trips %>% 
  mutate(time_diff=as.duration(dropoff_datetime-pickup_datetime)) %>% 
  mutate(different=abs(time_diff-as.duration(trips$trip_time_in_secs))>as.duration(10)) %>% 
  filter(!different)
#limiting fare codes to 1-6
trips <- filter(trips, between(trips$rate_code,1,6))
#removing irrelevant columns
trips <- select(trips, -vendor_id,-store_and_fwd_flag, -c(11:16))
View(trips)
```

### Fares file cleaning
```{r}
#Only consider data with cash or credit card payment
fares <- filter(fares, payment_type %in% c('CRD', 'CSH'))
#Remove data with fare amount less than or equal to 0
fares <- filter(fares, fare_amount > 0)
#Remove data which tip amount is more than 50% of fare amount
fares <- filter(fares, tip_amount/fare_amount < 0.5)
#Remove data with discrepancy between calculated total amount and total_amount
fares <- filter(fares, fare_amount+surcharge+mta_tax+tip_amount+tolls_amount==total_amount)
```

### Join Trips and Fares


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
